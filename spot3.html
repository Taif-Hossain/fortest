    <h2>
        If you want to see the land of the cloud in Bangladesh then you have to visit the queen of hills, Sajek Valley.
        Visiting this place will fulfill your dream of walking through the clouds. This is the best tourist spot in
        Bangladesh. The experience of going to Sajek by zigzag road through the cloud is really great. It is also called
        the roof of Rangamati because it is surrounded by hills. The valley is 1800 feet above from the sea level. If
        you are lucky enough, you can enjoy three forms of nature in a day.
